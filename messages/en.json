These Principles intentionally refrain from prescribing when personhood begins or ends; such determinations are to be based on scientific, philosophical, or spiritual inquiry and, where necessary, impartial arbitration. Interpretive Notice — The term Person does not extend to collectivised or fictitious legal persons—such as corporations, associations, or other aggregations—which may hold derivative rights only through the mandate of Persons as defined above.",
                "* Resource — A scarce, rivalrous, means of action that a Person can control to achieve an end. A Person's Body is a Resource, as can be things external to any Person's Body (\"External Resources\"). Information, ideas, patterns, and knowledge—being non-rivalrous—are not Resources. External Resources may be owned by individuals or jointly by groups of Persons through contract or joint appropriation. Group ownership does not grant any rights greater than those an individual Person may hold.",
                "* Right (Ownership) — A Person's exclusive authority to control a Resource and to exclude others from its use unless consented to by its owner. All rights are property rights.",
                "* Consent — Permission or license granted by a Resource's owner to another to use it or, in the case of External Resources, to transfer its title. The granting, or denial, of consent may be communicated expressly or implicitly, depending on circumstances, with a presumption that the most recent such communication prevails. Consent may be implied or presumed in certain circumstances, such as Negotiorum Gestio, in which a Person, the manager, acts to manage the affairs of and protect the interests of another, the owner, in the reasonable belief that the owner would approve of the action if made aware of the circumstances.",
                "* Aggression — The use, theft of, trespass against, or invasion of the borders of another Person's Resource without the owner's consent, including fraudulent takings of the Resources; or the credible threat thereof.",
                "* Guardianship — A fiduciary stewardship in which a competent Person acts on behalf of another Person who lacks present capacity for moral agency. Guardianship may arise from natural relationships (e.g., parent-child, close family ties with disabled persons), contractual arrangements, or community customs. Guardians are bound by these Principles, must act in the incapacitated Person's best interest, and are subject to review by impartial arbitration upon reasonable challenge.",

                "* Contract — A unilateral, bilateral or multilateral title-transfer arrangement—present or future—whereby the relevant External Resource owner or owners consensually grant ownership or license to use specified External Resources to others."

                "1. Non-Aggression Principle — Aggression against another Person's Resource is unjust, irrespective of the actor's status or scale. Aggression includes individual action as well as joint action, in which case participants in joint action may be liable for acts of the others, depending on the relationship between the actors and their causal connection to the Aggression.",
                "2. Self-Ownership — Every Person is the original and presumptive owner of their Body. Incapacity—temporary or permanent—does not nullify Self-Ownership. Self-Ownership may be forfeited, in whole or in part, as a consequence of committing Aggression, subject to principles of self-defense and proportionality.",
                "3. Original Appropriation (Homesteading) — Unowned External Resources become justly owned by the first Person (or association) who clearly demarcates, occupies, or productively transforms them, thereby establishing an objective, intersubjectively ascertainable link between the Person and the External Resource. Such ownership is retained until it is transferred by Contract, transferred for purposes of rectification, or abandoned. Abandonment may be determined by sufficient indications of intent such as long-standing inactivity, explicit communications, or failure to object to or prevent open and notorious adverse possession by another, which may mature into ownership absent timely challenge.",
                "4. Voluntary Exchange (Contractual Title Transfer) — A Person may acquire ownership of an External Resource by means of a Contractual title transfer from the previous owner. Such contractual title transfers may be partial or complete, conditional or unconditional, temporary or permanent, or immediate and contemporaneous or future-based, as the case may be and as specified by contractual terms of understanding between the relevant parties. Mere promises may give rise to moral obligations but do not result in legally binding obligations; contracts are consensual title transfers based on the owner's property rights in owned External Resources, which remain with the owner until transferred by Contract, transferred for purposes of rectification, or abandoned.",
                "5. Rectification — A proven aggressor owes the victim compensation proportionate to the harm caused. This may include transferring title to Resources. In assessing compensation, consideration shall be given to the extent of the damage, including the victim's subjective loss; the aggressor's degree of intent and underlying motives; and, pursuant to §10, the type and degree of punishment the victim could, in principle, impose on the aggressor."

Proportionality and Self-Defense — Defensive force in response to Aggression is justified, and is not itself Aggression, when reasonably necessary and proportionate to the threat, whether used immediately or after the fact. Where possible, self-help should be avoided pursuant to §11.",
                "8. Devices of Mass Destruction (DMD) — Possessing, developing, or deploying a DMD constitutes a presumptive standing threat when it foreseeably endangers innocent parties through indiscriminate or catastrophic effects. This presumption may be rebutted only by proving, to the satisfaction of all affected parties or a neutral arbiter, that robust safeguards eliminate substantial risk of wrongful harm. Where unrebutted, proportionate action—preceded, where practicable, by notice, dialogue, and arbitration—to neutralise the danger is justified; exigent circumstances may warrant immediate intervention.",
                "9. Presumptions of Title — The possessor of an External Resource is presumed to be the owner, which presumption may be overcome by evidence of superior title, including evidence of contractual transfer, rectification for Aggression, or abandonment. For property title disputes, the party proving the better claim to the External Resource prevails, taking any relevant presumptions and burdens and standards of proof into account.",
                "10. Evidentiary Standards and Procedures: Punishment. An Aggressor may, in principle, forfeit certain rights as a consequence of Aggression. The nature and extent of any remedy — whether compensatory, punitive, or protective — shall be determined according to community rules consistent with these Principles. Severe remedies require a heightened evidentiary standard, such as proof beyond a reasonable doubt, unanimous verdicts, double jeopardy protection, and jury authority over both law and fact. In cases of lethal Aggression, the right to forgive or settle rests with the victim's closest relations or as decided by impartial arbitration; where multiple victims are involved, arbitration may govern the conditions for forgiveness. Repeated or grave Aggression may establish an Aggressor as a standing threat, justifying proportionate defensive measures."

Aspirational Goals; Conflict-Avoidance & Compromise — Adopters of these Principles pledge to negotiate in good-faith, compromise where possible, and, when feasible, submit disputes to neutral arbitration rather than resort to force, thereby advancing conflict-free interaction. Self-help is to be avoided where possible, as is vigilante justice, acting as a judge in one's own case, or acting as an outlaw. All Persons adopting these Principles and seeking to benefit therefrom ought to aspire to comply with these Principles and to support the legal order of a free society attempting to implement and apply these Principles. The production of security may be entrusted to entrepreneurs or organized militias provided that such security contractors are bound by these Principles.",

Arbitration bodies and courts, with the consent of their clients, may agree on the establishment of courts of appeal and appellate courts to solve disputes between arbitral providers and protection agencies.",
